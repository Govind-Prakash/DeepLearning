# Deep Learning in Aging Research

This repository highlights deep learning projects leveraging TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other cutting-edge frameworks. It explores the potential of deep learning in addressing key questions in aging research:

-Can deep learning predict biological age in humans?<br>
-Can it forecast the onset of age-related diseases?<br>
-Could it unlock pathways to extend human lifespan?<br>

Through advanced pattern recognition, deep learning can analyze complex DNA sequences and biological data that are otherwise indecipherable by conventional methods. By uncovering hidden insights, these tools could pave the way for breakthroughs in understanding and mitigating the effects of aging.
